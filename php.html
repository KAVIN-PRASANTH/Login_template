    <h1>PHP INTRODUCTION:</h1>
    <p  class="para">
        The term PHP is an acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. It is open-source which means it is free to download and use. It is very simple to learn and use. The files have the extension ".php".
    </p><br>
    <h1>PHP VARIABLES:</h1>
    <p class="para">
        • A constant is used as a variable for a simple value that cannot be changed. It is also case-sensitive.

Assignment of variables is done with the assignment operator, "equal to (=)". The variable names are on the left of equal and the expression or values are to the right of the assignment operator '='.

• One must keep in mind that variable names in PHP names must start with a letter or underscore and no numbers.

• PHP is a loosely typed language, and we do not require to declare the data types of variables, rather PHP assumes it automatically by analyzing the values. The same happens while conversion. No variables are declared before they are used. It automatically converts types from one type to another whenever required.

PHP variables are case-sensitive, i.e., $sum and $SUM are treated differently

    <h1>DATA TYPES:</h1>
    <p class="para">
        Variables can store data of different types, and different data types can do different things.

PHP supports the following data types:

String
Integer
Float (floating point numbers - also called double)
Boolean
Array
Object
NULL
Resource

        [10:14 pm, 19/04/2022] C Nitish Cs: An array in PHP is actually an ordered map. A map is a type that associates values to keys. This type is optimized for several different uses; it can be treated as an array, list (vector), hash table (an implementation of a map), dictionary, collection, stack, queue, and probably more. As array values can be other arrays, trees and multidimensional arrays are also possible.

Explanation of those data structures is beyond the scope of this manual, but at least one example is provided for each of them. For more information, look towards the considerable literature that exists about this broad topic.

Syntax


Specifying with array()

An array can be created using the array() language construct. It takes any number of comma-separated key => value pairs as arguments.

array(

key => value,

key2 => value2,

key3 => value3,

)

The comma after the last array element is optional and can be omitted. This is usually done for single-line arrays, i.e. array(1, 2) is preferred over array(1, 2,). For multi-line arrays on the other hand the trailing comma is commonly used, as it allows easier addition of new elements at the end.

    <h1>OPERATORS:</h1>
    <p class="para">
        Operators can be grouped according to the number of values they take. Unary operators take only one value, for example ! (the logical not operator) or ++ (the increment operator). Binary operators take two values, such as the familiar arithmetical operators + (plus) and - (minus), and the majority of PHP operators fall into this category. Finally, there is a single ternary operator, ? :, which takes three values; this is usually referred to simply as "the ternary operator" (although it could perhaps more properly be called the conditional operator).

A full list of PHP operators follows in the section Operator Precedence. The section also explains operator precedence and associativity, which govern exactly how expressions containing several different operators are evaluated.
